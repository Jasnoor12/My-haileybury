        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Haileybury is one of the leading independent schools in the Asia-Pacific region with campuses in Keysborough, Brighton, Berwick, Melbourne (City), Darwin and Beijing. The School is acclaimed for its outstanding academic achievements, small class sizes, broad range of co-curricular activities, and state-of-the-art facilities. Learning is based on the different learning styles of students, and on their gender, age, interests and potential.


            The Berwick campus located on High Street has modern facilities and beautiful, spacious surroundings. The campus features an assembly and concert hall, indoor pool, a library and resource centre, multiple computer laboratories, four playing fields, six tennis and basketball courts, and a fully-equipped sports hall.

            The Haileybury Junior School Program has a strong focus on literacy and numeracy, which are the foundation schools off all learning at one of Berwick's top primary schools.

            As part of the parallel education model boys and girls learn separately in the middle and senior years. The Edrington Girls Middle School caters specifically to the Years 5 to 8 girls and provides them with a calming and engaging space that is their own. The separate learning areas create structure where the particular needs of pre-adolescent and adolescent girls can be met. During recess and lunchtimes boys and girls have the opportunity to mix and socialise in the common areas.

            <p class="text-muted text-left">Swimming is a key sport for our pupils both from a competitive and also a well-being perspective, and is an option year round for all our year groups.
We have a 25m indoor pool with six lanes and the pool is lifeguarded throughout the week.  The weekly programme includes both free swim opportunities for all, as well as nine windows for our performance squad to train for competitions.

Coaches include Sandy Blampied, a highly-experienced coach who has competed at the top level in South Africa, and Kate Liddiard (Level 2 coach) who also runs the Triathlon Squad.

Our girls’ freestyle relay squad made it into the national top 10 in the Bath Cup in 2019 and the young talent coming through is extremely exciting. We take part in both school galas, as well as the ESSA competitions and the Hertfordshire Schools’ League.

            <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">the most famous hall in haileybury edrington</h5>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">The John twist hall holds so many activities such as music, drama and dance here is some information about them. The Dance Program at Haileybury is vast and varied with students able to participate in dance from Prep through to Year 12 in many different ways. An after-school dance program is offered as an optional extra for Prep to Year 6 students across all campuses. Dance classes incorporate a variety of styles depending on the experience and interest of the students. Students build technique whilst having lots of fun and build routines for competition (Grades 5 and 6 students only) and the end of year Dance Gala. From Year 7 through to Year 12 Dance is part of the sport program and students can elect to participate in Dance as their chosen summer and winter sport. The selection process is based on audition and students who successfully make it into the Middle School and Senior School Dance Teams train twice weekly with an experienced coach and choreographer building a routine for competition. Students who are passionate and skilled dancers can also elect to study Dance at VCE by completing Units 1 to 4 in Dance. Students study prescribed works by well-known choreographers, learn dance works and develop their own solos for assessment as part of this course. Finally, there are many opportunities for students to be involved in Dance at a co-curricular level from Junior School through to Senior School by way of school musicals or the bi-annual Tattoo. Haileybury is acclaimed for the quality of its dramatic performances. Drama is part of the curriculum from the Early Learning Centre to Year 12.

             The co-curricular component is largely based around productions such as plays, musicals and variety shows.  Music and drama productions commence in Middle School. 

For more information about Drama at Haileybury, please contact the Director of Visual and Performing Arts via the Directory. aileybury offers many choral and instrumental ensembles at all campuses for all levels, ages and ability. 
Once a student has reached a basic level of proficiency they will be ready to join an appropriate core 
ensemble under the guidance of our experienced staff.
Access to this valuable program is included in the instrumental music lesson fee. Participation in the 
ensemble program is a requirement of learning an instrument at school. Students who learn a musical 
instrument outside the School are also welcome to participate in the ensemble program. So that was just a bit about what goes on in John twist hall.</p>
